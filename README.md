These are a few of my R works:

**Airplanes_RSQLite** is a database about flights analysis (mainly delays), primarily practising RSQLite package, ggplot and some ML prediction at the end.

**Electronic_sales** showcases using tools in tidyverse package (dplyr, ggplot, lubridate etc): exploratory analysis, then discovering interesting insights in the dataset, visualizing by customised, colourful plots 

**Machine-Learning_penguin** is an analysis of the kaggle penguin dataset using machine learning techniques; finding the optimal number of clusters, comparing 2 classificiation models, 
then finding the best fitting regression model for the data

**Data-scraping_word-cloud** is disovering web scraping with the rvest package, and showing visuals made with wordcloud packages.
