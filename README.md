These are a few of my R works:

Electronic_sales showcases using tools in tidyverse package (dplyr, ggplot, lubridate etc): exploratory analysis, then discovering interesting insights in the dataset, visualizing by customised, colourful plots 

Machine-Learning_penguin is an analysis of the kaggle penguin dataset using mchine learning techniques; finding the optimal number of clusters, comparing 2 classificiation models, 
then finding the best fitting regression model for the data

Data-scraping_word-cloud is disovering rvest web scraping, and wordcloud packages
